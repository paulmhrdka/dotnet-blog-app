## Application Layer

The Application project represents the Application layer and contains all business logic. 
This project implements CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), 
with each business use case represented by a single command or query. 

This layer is dependent on the Domain layer but has no dependencies on any other layer or project. 
This layer defines interfaces that are implemented by outside layers. 

For example, 
if the application needs to access a notification service, 
a new interface would be added to the Application and the implementation would be created within Infrastructure.
